It is "professional" in that it admits only students pursuing an engineering degree, and "social" in that members live together in chapter houses and run social and athletic programs. The Beta-Nu Chapter, chartered at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in 1962, carries that mission locally — advancing the engineering profession and education, building cooperation among engineering students, and fostering brotherhood.\n\n## Why this chapter\n\nSigma Phi Delta is a fraternity of engineers devoted to bettering engineering education and industry, as well as its men in membership. Here in San Luis Obispo, the Beta-Nu Chapter strives to uphold the traditions of its Brotherhood, passed down through the generations.\n\n## Next steps\n\n- [About the chapter](${site.url}/about)\n- [Fall Rush 2026 schedule](${site.url}/recruitment)\n- [Meet our brothers](${site.url}/brothers)\n- [Contact our officers](${site.url}/contact)\n\n## Quick contact\n\n- General: ${site.email}\n- Recruitment: recruitment.spd.calpoly@gmail.com\n- Instagram: ${site.social.instagram}\n- Facebook: ${site.social.facebook}\n`,

    `# About the Beta-Nu Chapter\n\n## Declaration of Principles\n\nFrom time to time the Fraternity, of the Greek system, is called upon to set forth the principles for which it stands. We stand steadfast in our belief that we serve as a necessary adjunct to our Colleges and Universities in the training of young engineers.\n\nOur Constitution states, without equivocation, that the Object of the Fraternity shall be to promote the advancement of the Engineering Profession; to foster the advancement of Engineering Education; to instill a greater spirit of cooperation among Engineering Students; to inculcate in its members the highest ideals of virtuous manhood, good citizenship, and brotherhood; and to encourage excellence in scholarship.\n\nWe are professional in that we admit only students enrolled in, or working toward, a degree in engineering. We are social in that we have houses where many of our members live together, and sponsor social and athletic programs for the active chapter and alumni.\n\n## History of the Fraternity\n\nSigma Phi Delta was founded on **${site.founded}** at the **${site.foundedAt}** in Los Angeles by civil engineering students who recognized the need for a brotherhood devoted to the engineering profession itself. Today, Sigma Phi Delta recognizes 36 chapters internationally.\n\n## Beta-Nu Emphasis\n\nThe Beta-Nu Chapter continues the national mission at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo by promoting the engineering profession, strengthening engineering education, encouraging cooperation among engineering students, and fostering brotherhood.\n\n## Pledge classes\n\n${pledgeClasses.map((p) => `- **${p.letter}** — ${p.name}`).join("\n")}\n`,
