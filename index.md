Sigma Phi Delta is a fraternity of engineers devoted to bettering engineering education and industry, as well as its men in membership. Here in San Luis Obispo, California, the Beta-Nu chapter of Sigma Phi Delta strives to uphold the traditions of its Brotherhood, passed down through the generations. As members, our priorities involve professionalism, as well as upholding our Code of Ethics. Throughout both pledging and active life, we are focused on not only being the best engineers we can be, but also the best men. Representing our ideals and tearing down barriers of stigma are what we stand for.
